# PA1_Part2

George Bousvaros did Part 1. George Bousvaros did Part 2.
Kaiwen Wei bugchecked and ran tests for both parts, implemented TreeMap to store commands and indexes for repl_jobs

Note to grader(s):
While running the testREPLJobs and testREPLMulitpleJobs tests, the indexes for the background commands were not matching up. We could not figure out the cause of the issue, however everything else in the output is the same as specified, and repl_jobs worked for the kill test. I included pictures of the discrepancies in output for the tests.
